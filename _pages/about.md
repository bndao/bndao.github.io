Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where you will find an overview of the bioinformatic analyses and visualizations I develop for internal and collaborative research projects.

As a Bioinformatics Engineer, I contribute to processing and interpreting high-throughput sequencing datasets (Whole Genome/Exome Sequençing, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomic, TCR-seq, Immunoinformatics). My work involves providing tailored solutions to complex scientific challenges using tools such as R, Python, Bash and high performance computing, enabling impactful collaborations with multidisciplinary teams.
With a background in Data Analysis and Modeling, I bring a strong foundation in data modeling and genomics, including hands-on experience in NGS analysis. My goal is to leverage bioinformatics expertise to support transformative biomedical discoveries while fostering innovation and collaboration.
