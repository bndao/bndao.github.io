               However, few vaccines are specifically designed to target CD4+ T
               cells in human cancers. Here, we characterize the immune
               mechanisms of UCPVax, a helper peptide vaccine derived from
               telomerase. Ex vivo immune profiling of peripheral blood from 60
               patients with advanced lung cancer reveals that UCPVax
               selectively activates CD4+ T cells in vivo across a broad HLA-DR
               restriction. The vaccine elicits a synergistic immune triad,
               including cytokine polyfunctional CD4+ Th1 cells, epitope
               spreading, and antibody response, contributing to effective
               tumor control. Single-cell analysis further demonstrates that
               UCPVax drives CD4+ T cells toward effector memory and cytolytic
               differentiation. Thus, vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells trigger
               broad and durable antitumor immunity. These findings highlight
               UCPVax as an off-the-shelf helper platform to enhance
               therapeutic cancer vaccine efficacy. This study was registered

               the tumor microenvironment which can lead to T cell dysfunction.
               Multiple studies, particularly in murine models, have
               demonstrated the capacity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
               to negatively regulate antitumor T cell functions. AHR is a
               cytoplasmic receptor and transcription factor that was
               originally identified as a xenobiotic sensor, but has since been
               shown to play a significant role in the gene regulation of
               various immune cells, including T cells. Given the insights from
               murine studies, AHR emerges as a promising candidate to
               invalidate for optimizing T cell-based cancer therapies.
               However, the controversial role of AHR in human T cells
               underscores the need for a more comprehensive characterization
               of AHR expressing T cells. This study aims to investigate the
               regulatory mechanisms of AHR in human T cell biology to better
               understand its impact on reducing antitumor immune responses.
               Here, we knocked-out AHR in human T cells using CRISPR-Cas9
               technology to characterize AHR's function in an in vitro chronic
               stimulation model. Engineered T cells exhibited enhanced
               effector- and memory-like profiles and expressed reduced amount
               of CD39 and TIGIT. AHR knockout enhanced human CAR-T cells'
               functionality and persistence upon tumor chronic stimulation.
               Collectively, these results highlight the role of AHR in human
               CAR-T cells efficiency.",
